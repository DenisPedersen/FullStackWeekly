Statically typed languages (Java, C++, C#): each variable and expression is already known at compile time.
Dynamically typed languages(JavaScript, Python, Ruby): variables can receive different values at runtime and their type is defined at run time.
TypeScript solves the problem that JS has with not knowing the type before compiling. 
The drawbacks are:
                  Compilation (Transpilation) (we need a compiler to translate TS to JS because the browsers doesn't understand TS)
                  TS needs more discipline, and therefore TS is better with bigger projects.


To compile a JavaScript-file from a TypeScript-file use:
        tsc index.ts (or whatever_your_file_is_called.ts)
